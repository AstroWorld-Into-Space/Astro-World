                  As an aspiring astronomer, your willingness to conduct meaningful research makes you stand out and I intend doing that, as an undergraduate student, I did not have the opportunity to involve myself in astronomical research, my research has been concentrated on solid state physics. I have two research work on solid state physics which are in the process of publication.

                    Manganese doped zinc selenide (ZnSe:Mn) films were deposited on glass substrates 
                    using the simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method in an alkaline medium at a 
                    bath temperature of 90 degree Celcius and deposition time was varied from 30 to 90 minutes. 
                    The films were characterized to obtain the optical properties and structural properties, microstructural 
                    properties and elemental properties using the Cary 300 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer- at normal incidence 
                    of light in the wavelength range of 200nm-800nm and the Rigaku miniflex 630 diffractometer, respectively 
                    and results from the work shows that the crystalline growth in the films were reduced as deposition time 
                    increased.

                    With my possible enrollement into graduate school, I intend to work on using Observational Data and 
                    Theoretical Modeling to study

                      how the efficiency of jet-driven and wind-driven feedback from supermassive black holes(SMBHs)
