      As an aspiring astronomer, your willingness to research makes you stand out
      and i intend doing that, as an undergraduate student, i didn't have the opportunity 
      to involve myself in astronomical research, my research was concentrated on solid state physics.
      I have two research work on solid state physics.

        My first work being the <a href="#" target="_blank">Effect of Deposition-Time On Chemical Bath Deposited Manganese-Doped Zinc Selenide Films.</a>
        Manganese doped zinc selenide (ZnSe:Mn) films were deposited on glass substrates using the simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method in an alkaline medium at a bath temperature of 90 degree Celcius  
        and deposition time was varied from 30 to 90 minutes. 
        The films were characterized to obtain the optical properties and structural properties, microstructural properties and elemental properties
        using the Cary 300 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer- at normal incidence of light in the wavelength range of 200nm-800nm and the Rigaku miniflex 630 diffractometer, respectively.

      <p>My Second work being the <a href="#" target="_blank">Effect of Molarity Concentration On Chemical Bath Deposited Manganese-Doped Zinc Selenide Films. </a>
         This is a co-joint work. Here Manganese doped zinc selenide (ZnSe:Mn) films were deposited on glass substrates 
         using the simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method in an alkaline medium at a bath temperature of 90 degree Celcius  
         and molarity concentration was varied from 0.05 mol to 0.1 mol. 
         The films were characterized to obtain the optical properties and structural properties, microstructural properties and elemental properties  
         using the Cary 300 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer- at normal incidence of light in the wavelength range of 200nm-800nm and the Rigaku miniflex 630 diffractometer, respectively.

      With my enrollement into graduate school, i intend to work on using Gravitational lensing to study 
      <a href="#"> how the efficiency of jet and wind-driven feedback from supermassive black holes influences the star formation process in dense galaxy clusters. </a> 
      as I know there are question that can be answered using this technique.
